<h3>Abstract</h3>

In recent decades, the issue of air pollution has been of particular concern as its effects are significant on both public health and the environment. Human activity with power plants, public transports and industry, has caused an increase in the accumulation of air pollutants, which makes it necessary to analyze air quality. The main goal of this dissertation is to model air quality with the help of machine learning. This data is related to the direction of the air, air velocity and the concentration of PM10 pollutants. This information is properly processed using the Python programming language tools and libraries to create a dataset, which in combination with the machine learning library scikit-learn achieved the desired predictions. During the experimental process, the technique of supervised machine learning algorithms was used and the problem was handled with the method of regression and classification. Finally, various methods are compared according to their accuracy.
